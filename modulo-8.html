                        My main go is to overcome this period of difficulty in terms of work. I am making a great effor into <strong>becoming a web developer</strong>,
                        and I´m sure I will achieve this. It might not be in the time being I expect; it might take a little longer, but I will achieve it. Because I am <a>working hard</a> and I am <em>dedicating myself</em>. I know there is a long way ahead of me, but I believe in hard work, dedication and sacrifice. It´s past midnight on a Friday and I´m here working on my website task. I just hope that God will guide me and push me in the times when I feel powerless and willing to quit. But that won´t happen!

                        I have spent a lot of time in other carrer. This has given me skills and experiences that I probably wound´t have had if I had started on computer science from the start. I believe this experience will <strong>take me higher than I could even imagine</strong>, and all I need to do is to keep pushing and keep focused. This is the type of subject I don´t feel compfortable sharing with strangers, especially the ones I can´t even see the face, but I have my long term goal on my head, and I´ve had it for a long time. For a momment I thought <a>this dream</a> was gone. However, <em>for some misterious reason</em>, I decided to study computer information and became interested in programming. This gave me a new purpose of life, a new motivation, and has worked as fuel to me in the past couple of months.
